Description: DMRforPairs (formerly DMR2+) allows researchers to compare 
        n>=2 unique samples with regard to their methylation profile. 
        The (pairwise) comparison of n unique single samples distinguishes
        DMRforPairs from other existing pipelines as these often
        compare groups of samples in either single CpG locus or region
        based analysis. DMRforPairs defines regions of interest as
        genomic ranges with sufficient probes located in close
        proximity to each other. Probes in one region are optionally
        annotated to the same functional class(es). Differential
        methylation is evaluated by comparing the methylation values
        within each region between individual samples and (if the
        difference is sufficiently large), testing this difference
        formally for statistical significance.
